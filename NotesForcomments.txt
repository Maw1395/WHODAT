Hey Michael!

Hope you had a good St. Patty's Day! Attached you'll find a copy of the resume I submitted for the 2016 scholarship.

I joined Phi Eta Sigma while I was abroad, finishing up Florida State's First Year Abroad Program. When I finally got to FSU's main campus, I dove straight into Phi Eta Sigma. I am currently a member of Cathryn's Leadership Committee, which runs PES's social media. I focus on getting information out to PES members through social media. In regards to volunteering in PES, although I am highly involved in many other things, I always make PES a priority and come to all the events I can to help. I stayed over at the letter stuffing party even though I didn't have to just so things would get done. I acme early to the Black and Gold Affair and helped Briana's committee even though I didn't technically have to. I will be at the convention this Sunday for sure, and definitely helping with induction on April 3. 

Hope this is sufficient for your intro. Let me know if you need any more help!

Best Wishes,
Emilie Easton
